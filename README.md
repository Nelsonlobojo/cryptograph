# Getting Started with this Project

This project serves as an encryption and decryption page over the web. The message is encrypted using the Triple DES algorithm as it is more secure than the standard DES algorithm.

The encrypted message is sent to the email of the responder and at the same time the decryption key is shared via OTP using Twilio API

On the same page, the user inputs the message and the decryption key where on success, the message is decrypted

# Technologies used

Node.js and express.js was used as the backend of this project while React was used as the frontend.
The email sending was handled by NodeMailer and OTP message handled via the Twilio API
